> This repo is just a sketchbook for notes on collaboration efforts that can be done to enhance mining pools.

# To do
### Open Ethereum Pools
- [ ] Create SA or **Mena nodes** for current coins' pools  
      work in progress
- [x] Add **estimated earnings 24h**  
      done, per worker and per miner
- [ ] Add **Earnings last 1 Hour**
- [ ] Add **Earnings last 24 hour**
- [ ] Add selectable payout schema (**PPS**/**PPLNS**)
- [ ] Add worker connected through which node
- [ ] Add worker connected through which diff
- [ ] Add **Dynamic Difficulty** port
- [ ] Add **Solo Port** feature
- [ ] Add **SSL** Stratum  
      can use [STunnel](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-encrypt-traffic-to-redis-with-stunnel-on-ubuntu-16-04#what-is-stunnel) for that purpose
- [ ] Add **Pool Luck Feature**
- [ ] Add **Multiple stratum region support for low latency**
- [ ] Add which worker found blocks ?
- [ ] Add Email Monitoring, for rigs down to miner (maybe an outside service reading redis)
- [ ] Add Telegram notifications for downed rigs
- [ ] Make website description a variable from config, add few words per page
  - Unit: 'ATH',
  - CoinName: 'Atheios',
- [ ] Create PowerPoint slides (images) showing different components of running a pool and their interactions, services, dependencies, applications, configs, nodes, stratums â€¦ etc.
- [ ] Change references to explorer in hbs files, move to environment.js
  - block explorerlink.tx = ''
  - blockexplorerlink.blockhash = ''
  - blockexplorerlink.txhash = ''
  - blockexplorerlink.blocknumber = ''
  - blockexplorerlink.Uncle = ''
- [ ] eye candy data inserted into db
  - shares per worker / period (defined in json)
  - accepted, rejected, stale
  - blocks last 24 hours per miner
  - block finder, on which diff and server
- [ ] another payout schema
  - in which pool op defines period length, all shares and division amount of reward totals during round happen at end




### Other Ideas
- [ ] Enhance Pools **Homepages**
- [ ] Pool signup for Listing on coin pages automation
- [ ] Create an installation script/security script
- [ ] Create better methods to ease the install process, its very confusing for new pool ops.
  - Inputs to Consider
    - link to the geth file
    - name of coin
    - abbreviation
    - average block time
    - block reward
    - pool fee
    - RPC port
    -
- [ ] Create better log file analysis features, possibly stored into redis for an admin page.

# Server Security Notes
- Disable Redis listen `0.0.0.0`
- Disable SSH Port `22`
- Disable Login with `root`
- Disable Login with password
- Close All ports except necessary
- Close incoming SSH connections from `0.0.0.0` except from main servers

- score based reward system instead of share based [commit](https://github.com/sammy007/open-ethereum-pool/commit/97c682b37589ed5d9955ca327bea56ab0135ff98)
- Add something to the block recording in redis [commit](https://github.com/sammy007/open-ethereum-pool/commit/9a97a89e4673759ae0850210006b12eb164b3d72) a workerName maybe?
